							<h3>WELLNESS MEAL - CORPORATE SECTOR</h3>
							<p>Sedentary lifestyle is linked to an increased risk of Obesity, Diabetes, Cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal problems. Moreover, prolonged sitting can also impact mental health leading to Stress, anxiety, and reduced Cognitive functioning. The mean daily duration of sedentary behavior is between 7 to 8 hours. Sedentary behaviors reduce lipoprotein lipase activity, muscle glucose, and protein transporter activities and diminish carbohydrate metabolism. It also decreases cardiac output and systemic blood flow ultimately reducing insulin sensitivity and vascular function. Increased sedentary time impairs the gravitostat, the body's weight homeostasis and weight gain, adiposity, and elevated chronic inflammation which are risk factors for cancer. Sedentary lifestyles have a major impact on the overall health of the population. A sedentary lifestyle and excessive intake of calories provide surplus energy more than our body needs which ultimately stores in adipose tissues and causes obesity. Obesity is characterized by positive energy balance, a condition in which energy intake exceeds expenditure. It is essential to maintain the proper functioning of the brain when working in the office. The daily diet should be Low in Calories, Rich in Vitamins and good Fats, and free from harmful ingredients. Highly processed food, full of flavor enhancers, salt, and sugar are not the best ingredients for that lifestyle. Veegen Diet Care has designed Wellness Meals for Individuals working in the Corporate sector having a sedentary lifestyle. The Diet has a Low Glycemic Index, fewer calories, More Micro Nutrients, and offers the same Taste as regular foods.</p>

							<h3>NUTRACEUTICAL FOODS </h3>
							<p>Veegen Diet Care has designed a wide range of Condition Specific Diets to meet the nutritional requirements or metabolic deficiencies of a particular disease state. These foods are specifically formulated to meet the distinctive nutritional requirements of a specific disease that cannot be met with a simple dietary shift. Increased Nutritional requirements of a specific disease can be the result of inadequate ingestion of nutrients, malabsorption, impaired metabolism, or the impact of drug therapies. The nutritional requirements of an individual in a disease state can be completely different from that of a healthy individual. With an increasing awareness about the relationship between Nutrition and disease, condition-specific or medical foods can be incorporated into the diet of the patient for a successful disease management strategy. Veegen Diet brings in the expertise to incorporate Nutraceuticals that are derived from food sources and are desired to provide extra health benefits in addition to the basic nutritional value found in foods.

The team of experts at Vegan Diet is able to design Nutraceutical Foods with the right combination of Nutrients and Taste so that it can be easily consumed by the Individual in a disease state.
