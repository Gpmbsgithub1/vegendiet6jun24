						<p style="text-align:left;">
					   Increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization, and changing lifestyles have led to shifts in dietary patterns. All the major recipes in the Food Processing Industry were developed over 100 years ago when lifestyle was healthy. In the existing scenario, a large number of people living in Cities lead a sedentary lifestyle and no physical activities, high-stress levels, low intake of fruits and vegetables, and high intake of calorie-dense foods. This has led to the onset of lifestyle disease at an early age with severity. Veegen Diet works on the reformulation of the existing foods, beverages, and dairy products by reducing or replacing Unhealthy Ingredients with Natural, Healthy, and Innovative ingredients that have been validated at a Scientific Level and approved by the regulatory authority. Veegen Diet Care Complete Wellness solutions to Individuals at the workplace and home to consume a Ready Meal which has a reduction of unhealthy ingredients from their existing recipes and replaces them with healthier alternatives that do not impact the Taste of the final product.
